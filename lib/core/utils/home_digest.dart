/// The Home attention digest.
///
/// Phase 1 of `docs/ANDROID_DAILY_DRIVER_ROADMAP.md` replaces the flat session
/// list with an attention-first Home. This file owns the *decision* half of
/// that screen — which session belongs in which section, in what order, and
/// what got hidden — as a pure function, so the ranking rules are testable
/// without pumping a widget and stay stable when the visuals are reworked.
///
/// Two rules drive the shape:
///
/// 1. **Attention outranks everything.** A session that needs the user is
///    never also reported as merely running: it appears once, at the top.
/// 2. **Never silently swallow work.** A capped section reports its overflow
///    and its true total, so Home can say "and 5 more" instead of pretending
///    the rest does not exist.
