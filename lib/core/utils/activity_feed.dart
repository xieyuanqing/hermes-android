/// The global Activity timeline.
///
/// Phase 1 of `docs/ANDROID_DAILY_DRIVER_ROADMAP.md` asks for a global
/// operational timeline: what is running, what is blocked, what failed, what
/// finished. This file owns the *decision* half of that screen as a pure
/// function, so the grouping rules are testable without pumping a widget and
/// stay stable when the visuals are reworked.
///
/// Its source is the durable turn recovery journal — the same store
/// [buildHomeTurnSignals] reads. That is deliberate: the journal already
/// survives process death, already knows what every turn was doing, and
/// requires **no new gateway contract**, so a legacy REST connection keeps
/// working (it simply has no journal scope and reports nothing).
///
/// Four rules drive the shape, and each differs from Home on purpose:
///
/// 1. **One row per turn, not per chat.** Home deduplicates to a single row
///    per session because it ranks *chats*. Activity is a timeline of *work*,
///    so a chat that ran three jobs reports three rows.
/// 2. **Never silently lose work.** Home drops a stale running turn because
///    drawing it as live would be a lie. Activity cannot drop it — it reports
///    it as stalled, which is the honest statement.
/// 3. **A recovery failure outranks the server's status.** A turn the server
///    completed but the client could not reconcile leaves the composer
///    blocked; filing it under Completed would tell the user the opposite of
///    the truth.
/// 4. **Never invent a row or a title.** Entries with no binding, and bindings
///    from another connection or endpoint, are ignored; a turn whose chat is
///    absent from the session list keeps its row but has no title.
