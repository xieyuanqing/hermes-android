/// Turns the durable recovery journal into Home's attention and running
/// signals.
///
/// Home already knows how to *rank* work ([buildHomeDigest]), but until now it
/// received no attention or running input, so every chat ranked as
/// `Continue working` and the shell's attention badge stayed empty. The turn
/// journal is the one place that already survives process death and knows what
/// a chat was doing, so it is the honest source for those two inputs — no new
/// gateway contract is required and legacy gateways keep working.
///
/// Three rules drive the shape:
///
/// 1. **Attention outranks running.** A session with any blocked turn is
///    reported only as needing the user, never also as running, so the digest
///    cannot show the same chat twice.
/// 2. **Never claim live work that is not live.** A running turn whose journal
///    entry has not moved for [kHomeRunningStaleAfter] is almost certainly a
///    zombie from a killed process, so it is dropped rather than displayed as
///    progressing. Blocked work is never aged out — being stuck is the point.
/// 3. **Never invent a row.** Entries with no matching binding, and bindings
///    belonging to another connection or gateway endpoint, are ignored.
///
/// See `docs/ANDROID_DAILY_DRIVER_ROADMAP.md`.
