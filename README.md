## Current release

- Version: **2.1.10** (build 2150)
- Package: `com.hermesagent.hermes_android`
- Recommended APK for modern phones: ARM64 release build from the
  [Releases](https://github.com/rusty4444/hermes-android/releases) page.
- Production builds are signed with a private release keystore. Debug APKs
  signed with the Android debug certificate remain available for testing
  under the `com.hermesagent.hermes_android.dev` package ID.
- Previous upstream releases remain available from the
  [Releases](https://github.com/rusty4444/hermes-android/releases) page.

## Remote Gateway edition highlights

- One Desktop Gateway JSON-RPC session for text, images, and files.
- Copy/select text, Read aloud, Stop, Edit and resend, Regenerate, and export.
- Up to 10 Remote Gateway attachments per draft, capped at 64 MiB total;
  generic files retain the 16 MiB per-file limit.
- File-backed app cache, metadata-sanitized JPEG/PNG/WebP images, ordered
  sequential upload, accessible reordering, remove, and individual retry.
  Sanitized JPEG inputs remain JPEG; PNG and WebP inputs are emitted as PNG.
- Legacy REST remains fail-closed to one image and does not expose multi-select.
- Per-chat model and thinking effort without changing the profile default.
- Search, Rename, Branch, and Delete for remote conversations.
- Native approval, sudo/secret, clarification, reasoning, tool activity,
  notifications, background results, reviews, and subagent status.
- Persistent reconnect/session resume and defensive retry handling.
- **Background turn notifications** — Android notifications fire when a
  gateway turn completes while the app is backgrounded, mirroring the
  Hermes Desktop tray notification behaviour. Notifications are
  automatically cleared when returning to the app.

### Gateway transport compatibility

Stock Hermes Agent releases do not currently advertise the experimental
`capabilities.turn_recovery` contract in `gateway.ready`. Against those releases,
the app intentionally uses the legacy Desktop Gateway transport and displays
**Background recovery unavailable — legacy transport**. If a legacy turn finishes
while Android is backgrounded, the app re-syncs that session's server-side
history on resume. The durable exactly-once recovery path activates only when a
gateway explicitly advertises the compatible recovery contract.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the complete `.13` change list and
[docs/HERMESAPK_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md](docs/HERMESAPK_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md) for the
sanitized implementation and validation record.

## What's new in v2.1.10

- **Existing chats stay on target** — sending from a server-listed chat now
  continues that exact session instead of creating a new sibling session.
- **Single creation path for new chats** — local drafts use recovery v2 without
  racing a second legacy session creation, while explicit fallback remains safe.

## What's new in v2.1.9

- **Interactive Gateway requests on Android** — clarification, approval, sudo,
  and secret prompts now reach the phone during a running turn and recover
  safely across reconnects.
- **Fast, safe large-chat restore** — large sessions load a bounded recent
  transcript without blocking the composer, then reconcile authoritative
  history without losing newer turns.
- **Accurate session status** — Android now uses the Gateway's explicit active
  state instead of treating every unended session as still running.

## What's new in v2.1.8

v2.1.8 fixes two connection-lifecycle problems diagnosed and resolved by
[@igitur](https://github.com/igitur) in PRs #111 and #113.

- **Custom HTTPS ports work as entered** — an explicit Port field value is
  honoured even when it is `8642`; leaving the field blank still infers `443`
  for HTTPS and `8642` for HTTP.
- **Turns survive leaving the chat** — navigating away during a running turn no
  longer closes its SSE connection and interrupts the work server-side. The
  detached client is released after completion, failure, cancellation, or its
  safety timeout.

## What's new in v2.1.7

v2.1.7 brings the Android daily-driver workspace into line with stock Hermes
gateways through the extensive compatibility work contributed by
[@Thaeland](https://github.com/Thaeland) in PR #106.

- **Reliable detached replies** — interrupted socket connections now resume the
  stored session, keep retrying across long-running turns and app backgrounding,
  and use durable message IDs so replies are recovered even when the server's
  capped history window rolls over.
- **Stock Projects support** — new Projects receive safely provisioned folders,
  chat moves use the stock `session.workspace.move` contract, and project labels,
  archived chats, migration, search, and compatibility states follow the real
  gateway wire shapes.
- **Correct session pagination** — pinned-session backfills can no longer skip,
  duplicate, or prematurely end later pages. Mutable OFFSET scans no longer
  delete local assignments they cannot prove are stale.
- **Safer transport and offline state** — stale runtime bindings reattach,
  socket creation and authentication are single-flight, network requests are
  bounded, and concurrent Project mutations cannot persist optimistic or stale
  cache snapshots.
- **Additional resilience** — archived reads are profile-scoped and complete,
  machine sessions stay out of human chat lists, deliberate reconnects are
  explained, and Android can discover installed speech-recognition services.

## What's new in v2.1.6

- **Private gateway certificates** — Android now trusts certificate authorities
  that the device user explicitly installed, so private Caddy and Tailscale
  gateway endpoints can connect without weakening normal certificate checks
  (#108).

## What's new in v2.1.0

v2.1.0 merges the community daily-driver workspace edition from
[@CarlosReyesPena](https://github.com/CarlosReyesPena) (PR #88): a new
Workspace home with Projects, Chats and Activity panes, server-backed session
search, config backup and restore, and quick-chat intents — plus a large
accompanying test suite (900+ tests).

- **Workspace shell** — a new Home with attention-ranked "needs you" digest,
  global New (project or quick) chat button, Activity operational timeline of
  gateway turns, and a More pane that routes Cron, Skills, Memory, Settings
  and the Hermes dashboard.
- **Projects pane** — server-owned Hermes projects via the gateway
  `projects.*` RPC family: project tree overview, per-project chats,
  migration preview and write path for local Spaces, chat moves between
  projects, per-project search, and safe deletion. Legacy gateways degrade
  gracefully to a labelled local-only compatibility mode.
- **Chats browser** — All / Recent / Unassigned / Archived filters, date
  grouping, running/done status, pinned and archived session flags, and a
  session→project label fallback for older APIs.
- **Session search** — three selectable modes: on-device (default), full-text
  via the dashboard FTS5 endpoint with matching-excerpt results, and
  AI-assisted query rewriting through Hermes (requires the corresponding
  server support). Mode is remembered per connection; provider API keys never
  leave the server.
- **Configuration backup & restore** — export all connections and app
  preferences to a single encrypted file (PBKDF2 + AES-256-GCM), import in
  merge or replace mode, with restore reachable from the empty-connection
  state before any server is configured.
- **Quick chat lifecycle** — share-target and app-shortcut entry points,
  share/review sheets for text and files, and a 72-hour quick-chat archive
  policy that never archives blocked or running work.
- **Resilience** — gateway capability discovery (never assume the newest
  server), fresh TCP per request with a 20 s timeout to fix stale keep-alive
  hangs, and runtime Android 13+ notification permission request.
- **Chat UI** — sticky context header (project, model, reasoning effort,
  connection state), You/Hermes role labels, long-press action sheet, real
  fenced code blocks with copy and wrap/scroll toggle, and full tool output
  on expanded activity cards.

## What's new in v2.0.1

- **Background turn notifications** — Android notifications fire when a Desktop
  Gateway turn completes while the app is backgrounded, mirroring Hermes Desktop
  tray notification behaviour. Notifications are automatically cleared when you
  return to the app.
- **Scroll bug resolved** — the inherited mid-history scroll-jump on session
  reopen (from upstream PR #71) has been fully resolved. The
  `ChatScrollCoordinator` only aligns to the end on initial load, never inside
  the streaming completion handler.

## What's new in v2.0.0

v2.0.0 merges the community Remote Gateway edition from
[@CristianGCiocoi](https://github.com/CristianGCiocoi).

- **Unified Desktop Gateway JSON-RPC transport** — text, images, and files share
  one WebSocket session instead of split REST+WebSocket paths.
- **Per-chat model and thinking-effort selection** without changing the profile
  default.
- **Multi-attachment uploads** — up to 10 files per message, 16 MiB each.
- **Copy/Select, Read Aloud, Edit+Resend, Regenerate, Stop, Export, Search,
  Rename, Branch, Delete** for conversations.
- **Native Desktop Gateway event handling** — approvals, sudo, secrets,
  clarifications, reasoning, tool activity, notifications, background results,
  reviews, and subagents.
- **Voice dictation** — stage voice input before explicit send.
- **Durable turn recovery** — completed gateway responses survive Android
  process-kill lifecycle events.
- **Persistent accessible text size** setting.
- **ATLAS document intake metadata** for mobile uploads.
- **Secure Android credential storage** with platform key material.
- **113+ Flutter tests** plus a synthetic gateway contract suite under
  `tools/fake_gateway/`.

## What's new in v1.0.8

- **Reverse-proxy path prefixes** — configure separate path prefixes for the Gateway API and dashboard, e.g. `/profile/peter` before `/api` and `/v1`, and `/dashboard` before dashboard `/api` routes.
- **Proxied dashboard mode** — enable **Dashboard behind proxy** when nginx/Caddy/your host injects dashboard authentication. In this mode the app sends clean dashboard requests without trying to scrape a dashboard session token or perform password login.
- **Prefix-aware validation and chat** — API-key validation, session browsing, existing chat history, streaming chat completions, and dashboard drawer screens all use the configured prefixes.

## What's new in v1.0.7

- **Password-protected dashboards** — the Memory/Cron/Skills/Settings tabs now work against a dashboard secured with basic-auth, not just an open (`--insecure`) one. The app logs in via the dashboard's `/auth/password-login` flow and reuses the session cookie (the same mechanism the desktop client uses).
- **Configurable dashboard port** — set a custom dashboard port per connection when it isn't the default `9119`.
- **Dashboard details in the connection flow** — set the dashboard port/username/password while adding a connection (expand **Custom dashboard details**) or later via **⋮ → Dashboard Login**, with validation before saving.

## What's new in v1.0.6

- **Voice chat support** — tap the microphone in chat to dictate a message to Hermes, and Hermes can speak the response back.
- Spoken replies can be toggled from the chat input bar.
- Android/iOS microphone and speech-recognition permissions are included.

## Features

- **Hermes chat on Android** — browse sessions, create new chats, and send prompts to your Hermes Agent.
- **Streaming responses** — chat uses the Hermes Gateway OpenAI-compatible streaming endpoint: `POST /v1/chat/completions`. Tokens appear in real-time with smooth auto-scroll.
- **Messaging-style UI** — dark/light/system themes, gold Hermes accent color (`#D4AF37`), markdown rendering, relative timestamps, and responsive phone/tablet layouts.
- **Gold/black Hermes branding** — distinctive gold accent on black background, custom app icon with mipmap densities, agent messages use grey bubbles.
- **Gateway API integration** — sessions and chat run through the Hermes Gateway API Server, normally on port `8642`, with HTTP and HTTPS endpoints supported. Reverse-proxy deployments can set a gateway path prefix that is applied before `/api` and `/v1` routes.
- **Dashboard integrations** — Memory, Cron Jobs, Skills, and Settings screens use the Hermes dashboard API (default port `9119`, configurable per connection) on the same host. Works with open (`--insecure`) dashboards, **password-protected dashboards** via the built-in login, and proxied dashboards where auth is injected upstream.
- **Model settings** — view and change the configured Hermes model where the dashboard exposes model settings.
- **Cron management** — list, trigger, pause/resume, create, edit, and delete scheduled Hermes cron jobs.
- **Skills browser** — view available Hermes skills with descriptions and trigger conditions.
- **Memory viewer** — inspect conversation memory across sessions.
- **Verbose mode toggle** — show raw message metadata (role, tool calls, timestamps) in chat.
- **Three-way theme toggle** — Dark / Light / System default.
- **Keyboard handling** — auto-scroll on keyboard open, send action on Enter, FAB to scroll to bottom.
- **Voice chat** — microphone dictation sends recognised speech to Hermes, with optional text-to-speech replies.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Android device or emulator (Android 8+).
- Hermes Agent installed on the host machine.
- Hermes Gateway API Server reachable from the Android device.
- `API_SERVER_KEY` from the Hermes host environment (`~/.hermes/.env`).
- Optional: Hermes dashboard reachable for Memory/Cron/Skills/Settings screens.

Hermes Agent docs: <https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs>

### Install the APK

Download the latest APK from this repository's
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rusty4444/hermes-android/releases) page.

For most Android phones, install the ARM64 APK:

```bash
adb install Hermes-Android-2.0.1-arm64-release.apk
```

If sideloading directly on Android, enable **Install unknown apps** for your browser or file manager, then open the downloaded APK.

### 1. Start the Gateway API Server

The Android chat/session features connect to the Hermes Gateway API Server. It must bind to an address your phone can reach, not only `127.0.0.1`.

Use your normal Hermes gateway/API-server startup command and confirm:

- host/IP is reachable from Android
- port is usually `8642`
- `API_SERVER_KEY` is available in `~/.hermes/.env`

### 2. Optional: start the dashboard for drawer features

Memory, Cron Jobs, Skills, and Settings use the Hermes dashboard API (default port `9119`).

Open dashboard (no login):

```bash
hermes dashboard --insecure --host 0.0.0.0 --tui --port 9119
```

Password-protected dashboard (recommended on shared networks) — start it with a
basic-auth provider instead of `--insecure`, then enter the username/password in
the app's **Dashboard / Proxy Settings** dialog (see [Dashboard access](#4-optional-configure-dashboard-access)).

> `--host 0.0.0.0` is required when connecting from another device. A localhost-only dashboard cannot be reached from Android.

### 3. Connect the app

1. Put the Android device and Hermes host on the same Wi-Fi/LAN (or connect via Tailscale — see below).
2. Find the Hermes host IP:

   ```bash
   # macOS
   ipconfig getifaddr en0

   # Linux
   hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
   ```

3. Open the Hermes Android app.
4. Tap **+** to add a connection.
5. Enter:
   - **Label:** any name, e.g. `Home`
   - **Host:** the host IP, e.g. `192.168.1.50`
   - **Port:** `8642`
   - **API Key:** `API_SERVER_KEY` from the Hermes machine
6. If your deployment is behind a reverse proxy path, expand **Custom proxy and dashboard details** and set the gateway/dashboard prefixes there. Do not put URL paths in the Host field; the Host field is just the scheme, hostname, and optional port.
7. Tap the saved connection to browse sessions.
8. Tap a session to start chatting, or create a new one.

### 4. Optional: configure dashboard access

The drawer screens (Memory, Cron Jobs, Skills, Settings) talk to the Hermes
dashboard, which can run on a different port from the Gateway API Server and may
be password-protected. Configure it per connection — either while adding the
connection (expand **Custom proxy and dashboard details** in the Add Connection dialog) or
afterwards:

1. On the connections list, tap the **⋮** menu on a connection → **Dashboard / Proxy Settings**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Gateway path prefix** — optional reverse-proxy path before gateway `/api`
     and `/v1` routes, e.g. `/profile/peter`.
   - **Dashboard path prefix** — optional reverse-proxy path before dashboard
     `/api` routes, e.g. `/dashboard`.
   - **Dashboard behind proxy** — enable this when the proxy injects dashboard
     authentication and the app should not fetch a dashboard SPA token or log in
     with username/password.
   - **Dashboard Port** — leave blank to use the default (`9119` for HTTP, or the
     same external port for HTTPS deployments), or set an explicit port if your
     dashboard is exposed elsewhere.
   - **Username / Password** — only for a password-protected dashboard. Leave
     both blank for an open (`--insecure`) dashboard.
   - **Hermes profile** — only when the dashboard is a *machine-level* one
     (`hermes dashboard` / `hermes serve` without `--isolated`) that hosts
     several profiles. Hermes scopes each JSON-RPC call on that socket by a
     `profile` field in the request, and falls back to its own default
     profile when it is missing, so without this field chats can quietly land
     in the wrong profile. Use the profile name exactly as in `hermes profile
     list`, e.g. `sol`. Leave blank for an isolated per-profile dashboard.
3. Tap **Save**. The app validates the settings against the dashboard before
   storing them.

When credentials are set, the app authenticates via the dashboard's
`/auth/password-login` flow and reuses the returned session cookie — the same
mechanism the Hermes desktop client uses.

## Connect remotely with Tailscale

Tailscale gives your phone and Hermes machine a private encrypted network, so you do **not** need to expose Hermes directly to the public internet.

Tailscale website: <https://tailscale.com/>

### Install Tailscale on Android

1. Install Tailscale for Android: <https://tailscale.com/download/android>
2. Sign in with the same Tailscale account/tailnet used by your Hermes machine.
3. Leave Tailscale connected while using the Hermes app.

### Install Tailscale on the Hermes machine

Install Tailscale for your OS: <https://tailscale.com/download>

Examples:

```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install --cask tailscale

# Debian/Ubuntu
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
```

After the Hermes machine is connected, get its Tailscale address:

```bash
tailscale ip -4
```

You can also enable MagicDNS and use the machine name instead of the `100.x.y.z` IP:

- MagicDNS docs: <https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns>

### Connect the app over Tailscale

In the Android app connection dialog:

- **Host:** the Hermes machine Tailscale IP, e.g. `100.64.12.34`, or its MagicDNS name
- **Port:** `8642`
- **API Key:** `API_SERVER_KEY`

If using Memory/Cron/Skills/Settings remotely, keep the dashboard reachable on the same Tailscale host at port `9119`.

## Connect over HTTPS

For hosted/reverse-proxy deployments (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces, VPS with nginx/Caddy), enter the full HTTPS URL in the **Host** field:

```text
https://your-hermes-host.example.com
```

If no port is included, the app uses port `443`. If your HTTPS service uses a custom port, either include it in the URL (`https://host.example.com:8443`) or set the Port field to that value before connecting.

Leave the **Port** field blank and the app infers the scheme default — `443` for HTTPS, `8642` for HTTP. A value typed into **Port** is always used as-is, including `8642` over HTTPS (for example a `tailscale serve` endpoint that terminates TLS on the API-server port). A port inside the Host URL (`https://host.example.com:8443`) takes precedence over the Port field.

For HTTPS connections, dashboard drawer screens use the same external HTTPS port. For local HTTP/LAN connections, chat uses port `8642` and dashboard screens use port `9119`.

### Reverse-proxy paths

If your proxy exposes Hermes under URL paths, keep the **Host** field to the origin only and put paths in **Custom proxy and dashboard details**:

```text
Host: https://your-hermes-host.example.com
Port: 443
Gateway path prefix: /profile/peter
Dashboard path prefix: /dashboard
Dashboard behind proxy: on, if the proxy injects dashboard auth
```

With that setup, the app calls gateway routes such as
`https://your-hermes-host.example.com/profile/peter/v1/chat/completions` and
dashboard routes such as
`https://your-hermes-host.example.com/dashboard/api/model/info`.

### Security notes

- Prefer Tailscale/VPN for remote use.
- Do not port-forward the Gateway API Server or dashboard directly to the public internet.
- Rotate `API_SERVER_KEY` if it is shared or exposed.
- Local/Tailscale examples use HTTP, so the private network boundary matters. Use HTTPS for public or hosted endpoints.

## Architecture

```text
Android app (Flutter)
├─ Gateway API Server, port 8642 or HTTPS proxy prefix
│  ├─ GET /api/sessions
│  ├─ GET /api/sessions/{id}/messages
│  └─ POST /v1/chat/completions  (SSE streaming)
└─ Hermes dashboard, port 9119 or HTTPS proxy prefix
   ├─ /api/memory
   ├─ /api/cron/jobs
   ├─ /api/skills
   └─ /api/model/*
```

## Using the app

### Chat screen

- **Send messages** — Type in the input field and tap the send button or press Enter.
- **Streaming responses** — The agent's response appears token-by-token in real-time. The chat auto-scrolls to the bottom as new tokens arrive.
- **Tool progress** — When the agent uses tools, inline progress messages show the tool name, status, and progress.
- **Verbose mode** — Toggle in the app settings to show raw message metadata (role, tool call IDs, timestamps).
- **Markdown rendering** — Assistant messages render markdown (code blocks, tables, lists, links).
- **Relative timestamps** — Messages show "2m ago", "3h ago", etc.

### Voice chat

The chat input bar has two voice controls:

| Button | Icon | What it does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Mic** | 🎤 / 🎤🔴 | Tap to start voice dictation. Speak your message — it appears in the input field and sends automatically when you pause. Tap again (or the red stop icon) to cancel. |
| **Voice reply toggle** | 🔊 / 🔇 | Toggles whether Hermes reads its response aloud after a voice-input message. On = 🔊 (volume up), Off = 🔇 (volume off). |

**How voice replies work:**

1. Tap the mic, speak your question, and wait for the recognition to finish (the text appears and auto-sends).
2. Hermes streams its response as text in the chat as usual.
3. After the full response arrives, if the voice reply toggle is on (🔊), the app reads the response aloud using text-to-speech.

Voice replies **only** trigger when you send a message via the mic button. Typed messages produce text responses only.

#### Setting up text-to-speech (Android)

Spoken replies require Google Text-to-Speech to be installed and configured on your device. The app uses the device's built-in TTS engine — it does not bundle its own voices.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Install Google Text-to-Speech** — If not already on your device, install from the Play Store: [Google Text-to-Speech](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.tts)
2. **Set as default engine** — Settings → Accessibility → Text-to-speech output → Preferred engine → **Google Text-to-Speech**
3. **Download voice data** — In the same TTS settings screen, tap the gear icon ⚙️ next to Google Text-to-Speech → Install voice data → select **English (Australia)** or your preferred English voice → download
4. **Check media volume** — TTS uses the **media** audio stream, not the ringer. Turn up media volume and make sure your phone isn't in silent/vibrate-only mode.
5. **Test TTS** — In the TTS settings screen, tap "Play" to hear a test phrase. If you hear it, the app should work.

**Troubleshooting voice:**

- **Mic button does nothing** — Speech recognition may be unavailable on your device. Ensure Google app is installed and has microphone permission.
- **Voice reply toggle is on (🔊) but Hermes doesn't speak** — Google TTS is likely not installed or has no voice data downloaded. Follow the TTS setup steps above.
- **Hermes speaks quietly or too fast** — Adjust speech rate and volume in Settings → Accessibility → Text-to-speech output.
- **Recognition is inaccurate** — Speak clearly, reduce background noise, and check that the device's system language includes English.

### Session list

- Browse all Hermes sessions.
- Tap a session to open its chat.
- Pull to refresh the session list.
- Create a new session from the session list header.

### Navigation drawer (☰)

Access these dashboard-powered screens:

- **Memory** — View conversation memory across sessions. Shows stored facts, preferences, and project context.
- **Cron Jobs** — List all scheduled cron jobs. Trigger, pause/resume, create, edit, or delete jobs.
- **Skills** — Browse available Hermes skills with descriptions and trigger conditions.
- **Settings** — View and change the configured Hermes model, theme preference, and verbose mode.

### Theme

- Three-way toggle: **Dark** / **Light** / **System default**.
- Gold Hermes accent (`#D4AF37`) on dark mode; adapted for light mode.

### Cron job management

The Cron Jobs screen supports full CRUD:

- **List** — See all jobs with status (enabled/disabled), next run, and schedule.
- **Create** — Tap **+** to add a new job with schedule (cron expression or interval), prompt, and optional skills.
- **Edit** — Tap a job to modify its schedule, prompt, skills, or status.
- **Trigger** — Manually run a job immediately.
- **Pause/Resume** — Toggle job enabled state.
- **Delete** — Remove a job (with confirmation).

## Development

```bash
cd hermes-android
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run -d android
```

## Build release APKs

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
mkdir -p release-apks
cp build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-*-release.apk release-apks/
```

`pubspec.yaml` declares the base Android `versionCode`. The F-Droid ABI-split
block in `android/app/build.gradle.kts` derives per-ABI codes as
`base * 10 + ABI code` (armeabi-v7a = 1, arm64-v8a = 2, x86_64 = 3), so the
codes stay ordered armeabi-v7a < arm64-v8a < x86_64 as fdroiddata requires.
For v2.1.10, base `2150` therefore produces codes `21501`/`21502`/`21503`.
CI reads the completed arm64 APK with `aapt` and fails if that relationship
drifts. Release-floor checks continue to apply to the base value and must not
be weakened to rely on the ABI code.

Output files:

```text
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-x86_64-release.apk
```

## Release checklist

Every release PR must complete [`CODE_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md`](CODE_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md) before tagging or publishing APKs. The checklist covers analysis, architecture, UX, security, release, and manual smoke-test checks.

Minimum release flow:

1. Update `pubspec.yaml` version.
2. Complete `CODE_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md` and record any exceptions in the release PR.
3. Build split release APKs.
4. Tag the release, e.g. `v1.0.0`.
5. Create a GitHub Release with all APK assets.
6. Confirm the repository visibility and release assets on GitHub.

## Troubleshooting

### I can see sessions but dashboard drawer screens fail

Chat/session features use port `8642`. Memory, Cron Jobs, Skills, and Settings use the dashboard on port `9119`. Start the dashboard with `--host 0.0.0.0` and make sure port `9119` is reachable over Wi-Fi or Tailscale.

### Chat fails with an auth error

Check that the Android connection's API key matches `API_SERVER_KEY` from the Hermes machine (`~/.hermes/.env`).

### The app cannot find the host

- Verify phone and host are on the same Wi-Fi or same Tailscale tailnet.
- Try the raw IP before a hostname.
- Check local firewall rules for ports `8642` and `9119`.
- On Android, ensure the app has network permission (granted by default).

### Streaming stops or messages don't appear

- The SSE connection may have timed out. Pull to refresh the session list and re-enter the chat.
- Check that the Gateway API Server is running and responsive: `curl http://<host>:8642/api/sessions`.
- If using a reverse proxy, ensure it supports long-lived SSE connections (no aggressive timeouts).

### Dashboard screens show empty or error

- Verify the dashboard is running with `--host 0.0.0.0` (an open dashboard also needs `--insecure`).
- If the dashboard is password-protected, set the username/password under **⋮ → Dashboard / Proxy Settings** (or **Custom proxy and dashboard details** when adding the connection). A 401 here means the credentials are wrong.
- If the dashboard sits behind a reverse-proxy path, set **Dashboard path prefix**. If the proxy injects dashboard auth, enable **Dashboard behind proxy** so the app sends clean requests.
- Check the dashboard port matches the connection (default `9119` for local/Tailscale, same HTTPS port for hosted; override it in Dashboard / Proxy Settings if needed).
- The dashboard must be on the same host as the Gateway API Server for the app's drawer to reach it.

### Voice dictation or spoken replies aren't working

- **Spoken replies not working** — Install Google Text-to-Speech, set it as the default engine, and download English voice data. See [Setting up text-to-speech](#setting-up-text-to-speech-android) above for step-by-step instructions.
- **Speech recognition not working** — Ensure the Google app is installed and has microphone permission (Settings → Apps → Hermes → Permissions → Microphone).
- **Voice reply toggle is off** — Check the speaker icon in the chat input bar: 🔊 = on, 🔇 = off. Tap it to enable spoken replies.
- **Media volume is zero** — TTS uses the media audio stream, not the ringer. Turn up media volume with the physical volume buttons while on the home screen.
- **Hermes speaks but audio is quiet or fast** — Adjust speech rate and volume in Settings → Accessibility → Text-to-speech output.

### Host field examples

The app accepts any of these forms and normalizes them when saving:

```text
192.168.1.50
192.168.1.50:8642
http://192.168.1.50:8642
100.64.12.34
hermes-machine.tailnet-name.ts.net
https://your-hermes-host.example.com
https://your-hermes-host.example.com:8443
```

For hosted paths such as `https://your-hermes-host.example.com/profile/peter`, enter `https://your-hermes-host.example.com` as the host and `/profile/peter` as the **Gateway path prefix**.
